# Fradulent-Job-Posting-Detection
A project that integrates Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to analyze job postings and determine their authenticity. By evaluating textual data and key parameters, the system identifies fraudulent job listings while providing a user-friendly interface for a user to input the data.
Below is the overview of the code files

Frontend:
1.Group3_Source_program1.html – Contains the frontend code for the application, responsible for user interaction and input submission.

Backend:
1.app.py – A Flask-based backend that processes input from the frontend, feeds it into the trained machine learning model, and returns predictions.
2.Preprocessing_P – Implements the preprocessing pipeline and machine learning models for data transformation and prediction.

Data Analysis and Model Training:
1.Data_Analysis_and_Model_Training.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and statistical analysis for selecting the best-performing model.

Reports and Documentation:
1.Data_Mining_Final_Report.pdf – Comprehensive documentation of the project, including methodology, findings, and conclusions.
2.data_mining_presentation.pptx – Presentation summarizing the key aspects of data mining, model development, and evaluation.
